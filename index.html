              <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
       <h2> <p>I intended to become a artist who did animation and create my own character designs; things changed.
      As someone who grew up playing video games most of the time, I created fond memories of these inspiring stories making it obvious to choose art as a major.
          I knew that video is a story in itself as it guided the viewer through sections creating memories that stay with you.</p>
          As a huge advocate for video art I wanted to develop storytelling through new media such as video games and video. Video games along with video art allows the audience experience new media in a way using contemporary art in media to express an artist’s view in the digital age.
          My ultimate goal is to have people see video art and video games as the future since I believe storytelling and immersion of emotion is powerful in ways physical art cannot achieve. I want to be the person who can tell a story with these tools, which is why I am here to tell my stories through my mediums.

     Uitilizing moviemaker, I edited multiple clips taken together
  and borrowed video clips that empower my passion and creativity through a narrative video. It
lets me declare my passion of storytelling and show my strength as a DMA major with this video called Genesis 6.

Using Premiere Pro as a tool, I was able to develop "Four Horseman" which would be used in a art gallery installation. I used the concept of death, pestilence,war, and famine to represent them in video using unique transtions/effects.

 With my tesselation project, I put together a documentation of our laser cut wood through Premiere Pro to repesent the nothces and connections. I am able to remind myself as to how a project is to be presented using music and camera angle to have a clear view of materials.
